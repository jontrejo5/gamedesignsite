                | Super Shoot man will be a first person shooter built in the Unreal Engine 4, for Windows systems. The plan for this project is to design a sci-fi shooting game in which the player has to fight swarms of evil enimies called Zorgs. There will be different types of Zorgs with different actions. There will also be some type of destructable environment elements. It will also have multiple maps and levels. The game will take inspiration from games like Serious Sam and Half Life.

                | Super Shoot man will have a set number of levels. Each level will have enemies that the user will have to eliminate for score. Score will depend on various factors such as where the shot was placed, and how quickly in succession each enemy was eliminated. Faster accurate shots will result in a higher combo.

                | For the sake of the scope of this project, there will be just one main level. This level will consist of several spawn points for enemies placed throughout the map. The map will also include different ways to destroy enemies such as exploding barrels or traps. As the level progresses, there will be more and more enemies
